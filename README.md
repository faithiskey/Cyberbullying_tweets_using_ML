# Cyberbullying_tweets_using_ML
Project Description

This project focuses on detecting cyberbullying in tweets using machine learning techniques. Cyberbullying is a pervasive issue on social media platforms, and identifying harmful content is essential for creating a safer online environment. The project leverages data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms to classify tweets as cyberbullying or non-cyberbullying.

Features

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Includes removing noise, handling missing data, and normalizing text.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distribution, common words, and other patterns in the dataset.

Feature Engineering: Extracting features like word embeddings, TF-IDF vectors, and other linguistic markers.

Machine Learning Models: Training and evaluating models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and more.

Performance Metrics: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix for model evaluation.
